--- Add these three matrices side by 
    side (excluding zero). Add the 
    largest prime factor of the resulting 
    number to the logarithm you found earlier, 
    then enter it into the logarithm again. 
    Convert the resulting number back to a 
    memory address. Then, examine the trash.asm 
    code in more detail with the three addresses 
    you have ---
